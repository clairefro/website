Two weeks ago I launched this personal website with an air of pride that everything was built to be simple. You can read about it [here](/blog/p/look-ma-no-react-why-i-recoded-my-portfolio-site-with-vanilla-everything).

In the spirit of 'keeping it simple' I took the most low-touch approach to styling: white background, native webfonts, a two color theme inspired by a potato, everything left-aligned, and a two line media query that made the site responsive on all devices. It would have a deliberate grungy 90's feel.

Several people reached out to me with feedback about the new website. One was **Sanket Pathak**, the Design Ops Lead at Postman where I work. In polite terms he told me something I already knew deep down: the design had room for improvement.

## Accepting help

I was hesitant at first to accept help with a redesign of the website. This was partly because I'm lazy, but also because next-to-no-style was the aesthetic I was stubbornly clinging to. There was also the fact that this is my personal website and I felt the style largely should be "my own".

But Sanket did have a point about some accessibility issues so it was worth exploring.

He asked me what look I was going for, to which I answered "potato" and left him to do his thing. Quickly he came back with a stunning Figma design that made me lose any and all attachment to my old design. See before and after:

Sanket's design (right) not only made the site look much more like a potato, it also solved the accessibility woes that stemmed from my strange attachment to using a gold accent on a white background. I absolutely loved his proposal and implemented the majority of the changes right away.

## Letting go is gaining

Before I was clinging too hard to my "grunge aesthetic"

too much yellow

## Trying before denying

system fonts

## Learning in public is The Way

## It's still me

- style
  -> clinging too hard to grunge aesthetic
  -> overdoing accents
  -> system fonts https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/
  https://booking.design/implementing-system-fonts-on-booking-com-a-lesson-learned-bdc984df627f

- simple should still be accessible
  -> colors

- Openness begets growth
  stubborness blocks growth
  If I had not been open

- try before you deny
  -> system fonts
  -> "too much accents"
  -> accessible colors

- learning in public is the way
  -> no fewer than 10 people reached out to me with feedback, some of them strangers. did i agree with them all? no. Did i make changes? quite a few.
  -> push out of your box
  -> free advice
  -> lost nothing and gained new sense and skills

- happy it looks more polished, and like a potato

- onto the next project

I'm not sure what I did to deserve Sanket's good vibes, talent and patience as we collaborated outside of work on tweaking the design, but I am certainly grateful for the whole experience.

elegant, easy to read, and most importantly looks like a potato

By the way, the website's Lighthouse score improved to all-green. Note that the "Best Practices" score would be 100% if not for the low-resolution "Clicky analytics" banner in the footer, which is unfortunately necessary by law.
