          <h2>Relaxing shiatsu in Corvallis, OR</h2>

          <p>
            Rooted in traditional Eastern medicine, shiatsu (指圧) is a gentle,
            hands-on practice from Japan that uses meditative touch and
            stretching along the energy channels of the body to invite your
            energy back into natural flow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than fix or force, each shiatsu session honors your whole
            being without judgment, opening a space to gently stir the hidden
            stagnations at the root of dis-ease and help you show up to life’s
            changes with clarity, resilience, and an open heart.
          </p>

            Claire spent her twenties as a Japanese interpreter in Hokkaido
            where she experienced the benefits of Eastern medicine first-hand.
            The island's vivid seasons and wild abundance deepened her respect
            for the rhythms of nature. While valuing language as a stepping
            stone, she's most drawn to the truths words cannot reach.

          <h2>Testimonials</h2>
          <blockquote>
            The session itself was incredibly relaxing, and I was impressed by
            how intuitively Claire seemed to identify areas of tension and
            imbalance through simple touch. The overall experience felt like a
            melange of therapeutic bodywork, deep relaxation, and healing energy
            work - restorative on multiple levels
          </blockquote>
          <p>- Irena W.</p>
          <blockquote>
            Claire is incisive, present, and flexible in her approach all while
            maintaining a steady hand. I not only learned more about the art of
            shiatsu by working with her, I also learned more about myself. Every
            time I left one of her sessions I felt lighter and more connected.
