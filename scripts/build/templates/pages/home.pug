      ## About
      I'm a self-taught hacker with a background in linguistics and interpreting. I believe language and technology to help us get over language and technology.

      Borges is my muse, and Jonathan Basile's [digital Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/) is my favorite page on the world wide web.

      I like simple solutions. This website is a rebuild of my old portfolio site, with vanilla everything. Just markdown, file-based routing, and CSS. You can read why in [this blog post](/blog/p/look-ma-no-react-why-i-recoded-my-portfolio-site-with-vanilla-everything). The color scheme is inspired by [*yaki-imo*](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%8A%8B&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1iojH8e31AhVGkokEHa3QAHwQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1063&bih=539&dpr=2.5) (baked Japanese sweet potato).
