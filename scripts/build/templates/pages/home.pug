      ### About
      My entry into tech is non-traditional. For six years I was a Japanese-English interpreter and translator, first for the City of Sapporo in Hokkaido then Amazon Japan. In 2019 I completed a full stack web development bootcamp in Montreal, then started freelancing before landing a job as a software developer at an ed-tech startup. Currently I am doing devrel-ish things at Postman helping promote API literacy among students. 

      If you're curious about what a journey from liberal arts into tech looks like, have a listen to my story in [this podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1nJAbfkejk3Q3omf29UqVt) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pF1HKE4ZoOk).

      I like simple solutions. This website is a rebuild of my old portfolio site, with vanilla everything. No Javascript frameworks, CSS libraries or flashy animations - just markdown, html templating and basic CSS. You can read why in [this blog post](/blog/p/look-ma-no-react-why-i-recoded-my-portfolio-site-with-vanilla-everything). The color scheme is inspired by [*yaki-imo*](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E7%84%BC%E3%81%8D%E8%8A%8B&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1iojH8e31AhVGkokEHa3QAHwQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1063&bih=539&dpr=2.5) (baked Japanese sweet potato).
